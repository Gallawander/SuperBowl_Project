# SuperBowl_Project
#### Data Camp's Super Bowl Project
This is the Data Camp's project in Python. It focuses on the Super Bowl data in terms of the specific match, the match break and the artists who performed during it, and the number of TV viewers who watched the game.
##### Questions that we tried to answer:
* What are the most extreme game outcomes?
* How does the game affect television viewership?
* How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
* Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?
##### The process we had to go through to get the answers
* We loaded, cleaned, and explored Super Bowl game, television, and halftime show data
* We visualized the distributions of combined points, point differences, and halftime show performances using histograms
* We used line plots to see how ad cost increases lagged behind viewership increases
* We discovered that blowouts do appear to lead to a drop in viewers
#### Conclusions
Most TV viewers seem to be interested in the Super Bowls, where the score is tight. According to the correlation plot, the larger the score difference, the more TV viewers change the channel before the end of the game. However investments to the advertisment and halftime shows appear to have a positive impact on the number of TV viewers. In terms of the halftime shows, it's important to note that the duration of the performance is fixed (roughly 12 minutes) so songs per performance is more a measure of how many hit songs you have. Most non-band musicians are able to do 1-3 songs per halftime show. JT went off in 2018 with 11 songs! Diana Ross comes in second with 10 in her medley in 1996.
